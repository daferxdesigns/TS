This takes out NBN for comm’s and telephony as well as the fridge, oven, dishwasher and lights etc and entertainment systems. The switchboard and mains-feed from the street was all a brand new upgrade before you guys installed, so it’s not an overload or circuit-imbalance problem. Some weeks the blackouts occur every one or two days and on some days it can happen more than once. The outages usually occur during daytime. Right now, the system is currently not performing as it should, or as we expected.\r\n\r\nI’m suspecting that something is wrong with your ATS switch that is meant to elegantly and seamlessly control the cutover from battery to mains and then from mains back to battery, when required. It would explain why the power goes totally off when there is still mains power available.\r\n\r\nCan you have someone dial in to Ewan’s system to interrogate the history (you should see many outage events) then arrange a site-visit for a suitably qualified technician to inspect and rectify this problem for us? I’m not sure if this is something that you can pass straight to Ben, the local installer you engaged, but I wanted to report it to you guys in the first instance in case you were already aware of similar problems with this same hardware combination at other sites, and already had a known-fix for this really annoying recurring issue.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what can be done to remedy this ASAP?', 'low', 'resolved', 0, 0, 2, '2025-05-06 07:29:04', '2025-05-27 07:24:37'),
