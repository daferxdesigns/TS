## Features to Pay Attention To

This project goes beyond the default Laravel Breeze setup with the following enhancements.

1. Return Types in the Controller: ex. `function destroy(Task $task): RedirectResponse`
2. Utilizes Form Request classes for validation, with `$request->validated()` then used in the Controller
3. Includes Factory and Seeder for the `Task` Model
4. Uses pagination in Controller
5. Modifies Laravel Breeze React component `InputLabel.jsx` to add a "required" asterisk parameter
6. Created a custom React component `SelectInput.jsx` for the dropdown using the same Laravel Breeze CSS styles
7. Uses "flash" messages in the session to show the result after store/update/delete. Adds a custom React component `AlertMessage.jsx` for this.
8. Transform the links to look like buttons visually, with the same Tailwind styles as Laravel Breeze components. Adds a custom React component `LinkButton.jsx` for this.
9. Includes Pest test file `TasksCRUDTest` that has methods to test all Controller routes and also validation of each field.
